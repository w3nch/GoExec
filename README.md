### GoExec — Golang Offensive Execution Framework

High-performance network execution and enumeration framework written in Go.


## About GoExec

GoExec (Golang Offensive Execution Framework) is a modern, high-performance network execution and enumeration framework built entirely in Go.

It is designed for:

- Red team operators  
- Security researchers  
- Active Directory lab environments  
- CTF players  
- Offensive security engineers  

GoExec leverages Go’s concurrency model to provide fast, scalable, and reliable network operations across enterprise environments.


## Philosophy

GoExec is built with three core principles:

- Performance through concurrency  
- Modular and extensible architecture  
- Clean and maintainable codebase  

The framework focuses on speed, stability, and structured output while remaining lightweight and portable.


## Core Objectives

- Massive parallel authentication and credential spraying  
- Remote execution modules  
- Active Directory enumeration capabilities  
- Protocol-based modular expansion (SMB, LDAP, WinRM, SSH)  
- Structured JSON output support  
- Plugin-based architecture  


## Disclaimer

GoExec is intended for authorized security assessments, research, and lab environments only.  
Users are responsible for complying with all applicable laws and regulations.
